A multi-purpose Video Labeling GUI in Python with integrated SOTA detector and tracker. Developed using PyQt5.

The fork includes better functionality for Linux and Windows setups, as well as the merging of UltimateLabeling's server and client into just one utility.

## Features
- SSH connection to a remote GPU server (see below to configure the server)
- YOLO and OpenPifPaf integrated object & pose detectors (single frame/video mode)
- Hungarian algorithm for track_id assignment
- SiamMask visual object tracking for missing or mislabeled boxes
- Zoom on video, resizable bounding boxes and skeletons
- Dark mode!

The integrated object detectors and trackers are based on the following codes:
- [OpenPifPaf](https://github.com/vita-epfl/openpifpaf): for human pose estimation
- [YOLO darknet](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet): for object detection
- [SiamMask](https://github.com/foolwood/SiamMask): for visual object tracking
- [Hungarian algorithm (scipy.optimize)](https://github.com/scipy/scipy): for optimal instance ID assignment


## Installation

Start by cloning the repository in your computer's home directory (there are some hard-coded paths in the code I haven't got rid of yet):
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/starkgate/UltimateLabeling.git
```

We recommend installing the required packages in a virtual environment to avoid any library versions conflicts. The following will do this for you:
```bash
cd ~/UltimateLabeling

# prepare the virtual environment for the client
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# prepare the virtual environment for the siamMask utility
cd ~/UltimateLabeling/siamMask
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
bash setup.sh

# prepare the virtual environment for the detection utility
cd ~/UltimateLabeling/detection
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
bash setup.sh
```

Finally, open the GUI using: 
```bash
cd ~/UltimateLabeling
python -m ultimatelabeling.main
```

The data images and videos should be placed in the folder `data`, similarly to the client code.

To extract video files, use the following script:

```bash
bash extract.sh data/video_file.mp4
```


## Input / output

To start labeling your videos, put these (folder of images or video file, the frames will be extracted automatically) inside the `data` folder. 

- Import labels: To import existing .CSV labels, hit `Cmd+I` (or `Ctrl+I`). UltimateLabeling expects to read one .CSV file per frame, in the format: "class_id", "xc", "yc", "w", "h".

- Export labels: The annotations are internally saved in the `output` folder. To export them in a unique .CSV file, hit `Cmd+E` (or `Ctrl+E`) and choose the destination location.

If you need other file formats for your projects, please write a GitHub issue or submit a Pull request.


## Shortcuts / mouse controls

<img src="docs/keyboard_shortcuts.jpg" width="50%" />

Keyboard:
- A (or Left key or Q on AZERTY): next frame
- D (or Right key): previous frame
- W/S: class up/down
- E: start/stop tracking
- J/Shift-J: jump to next/previous frame with different bounding boxes than the current frame
- Delete: remove current frame from list
- Numberpad: assign given class_id
- Spacebar: play the video

Mouse:
- Click: select bounding box
- Click & hold: move in the image
- Cmd + click & hold: create new bounding box
- Right click: delete bounding box in current frame (+ in all previous / all following frames if the corresponding option is enabled)
- Scroll wheel (or swipe up/down): zoom in the image
